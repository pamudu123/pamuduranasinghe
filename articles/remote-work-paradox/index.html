                    <h1>The Remote Work Paradox: A Quantitative Analysis of Professional Work-Life Balance in 2025</h1>
                </div>

                <img src="./remote-work-paradox-gemini.png" alt="Remote Work Paradox"
                    style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 2rem;">

                <p>Flexibility was supposed to be the answer to burnout. But new data suggests that while remote workers
                    have reclaimed their time, they might be losing their connection.</p>

                <p>Since the global shift in 2020, flexible work has evolved from a pandemic necessity to a standard
                    expectation. By 2025, we’ve settled into new rhythms: some of us are fully remote, some are back in
                    the office, and many are navigating the hybrid middle ground.</p>

                <p>But is “flexibility” actually fixing our work-life balance?</p>

                <p>To answer this, I conducted a quantitative analysis of 50 professionals across various sectors - from
                    IT to Healthcare - between June and July 2025. This research was conducted as part of my Master’s
                    project in Statistical Inference.</p>

                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>

                <h4>1. The Remote Trade-Off: Better Balance, Higher Isolation</h4>
                <p>Fully remote workers report significantly lower levels of "Work Interference with Personal Life"
                    (WIPL). However, this freedom comes with a hidden cost: markedly higher social disconnection scores
                    compared to hybrid or on-site employees.</p>

                <h4>2. Hybrid Work: The "Safe" Middle Ground?</h4>
                <p>Hybrid workers sit in the middle of the spectrum - less isolated than remote workers but facing more
                    work-life interference. Interestingly, the difference in "work interference" levels between hybrid
                    and on-site workers wasn't statistically significant.</p>

                <h4>3. The "Switch Off" Button is Broken</h4>
                <p>Nearly 60% of the variance in a person's ability to "switch off" is driven by work interference
                    (workload intensity and boundary intrusion), not by the arrangement type itself.</p>

                <h4>4. The Industry Divide</h4>
                <p>Flexibility isn't distributed equally. IT and Engineering roles enjoy the most flexibility, while
                    sectors like Healthcare remain tied to fixed schedules.</p>

                <h4>The Verdict</h4>
                <p>Flexibility is a tool, not a cure-all. While remote work reduces life interference, it creates a
                    vacuum of social connection that organizations must actively fill.</p>

                <h3>A Look Under the Hood: Adapting the Survey for 2025</h3>
                <p>I heavily adapted Hayman’s (2005) Work-Life Balance Scale and created entirely new questions to
                    address modern challenges such as AI integration, digital boundary management, and remote social
                    isolation.</p>

                <div class="survey-box">
                    <h4>Work Interference with Personal Life (WIPL)</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>My personal life suffers because of my work.</li>
                        <li>I feel I have to reply to work messages or e-mails after hours.</li>
                        <li>Work is so fast-paced that I cannot fully relax after hours.</li>
                        <li>I am unhappy with the amount of time for non-work activities.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>Personal Life Interference with Work (PLIW)</h4>
                    <ol start="5">
                        <li>My personal life drains me of the energy I need for my work.</li>

                        <li>Because of personal commitments, I take part less in team communication or meetings.</li>
                        <li>I do not spend much time with teammates outside work because of personal matters.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>Work/Personal-Life Enhancement (WPLE)</h4>
                    <ol start="9">
                        <li>I have enough control over my job to manage both work and personal life well.</li>

                        <li>My job helps me feel energetic for my personal life too.</li>

                            flexibly.</li>
                        <li>I feel comfortable talking to my manager if I am overwhelmed or stressed.</li>
                        <li>I find it difficult to “switch off” from work at the end of the day when working from home.
                        </li>
                        <li>Working remotely makes me feel socially disconnected from colleagues and company culture.
                        </li>
                        <li>The digital tools and communication platforms we use help me collaborate effectively with my
